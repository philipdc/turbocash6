# Source Code Directory

This directory contains the source code for TurboCASH 6, organized into logical modules.

## Structure

- **components/**: Reusable UI components
- **modules/**: Feature-specific modules
- **services/**: API and data services
- **utils/**: Helper functions and utilities

Services should:
- Manage data and API calls
- Handle business logic
- Provide abstractions

### Utils

Utilities should:
- Be pure functions when possible
- Have single responsibilities
- Be well-tested
