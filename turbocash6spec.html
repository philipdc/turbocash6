            <div>
                Yes. The primary data is stored in Firebird SQL for persistence, while extracted and transformed data for AI workflows can be stored in a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB). The system architecture supports interchangeable NoSQL backends via an abstracted data access layer.

##### Markdown

The aim of TurboCASH 6 is to write an AI-facing accounting package using JavaScript on front and back ends.

The package is written under an open source license.

The package must be self-standing and interoperable with TurboCASH 5 (a proprietary closed Delphi system), that has open source components and an open API to interact.

Define a system architecture that has "TurboCASH Server running on a Windows 10 or 11 PC, Windows 11 Pro not required, Linux would be nice.

Single language JavaScript

Such a system must be able to CRUD a record into a TurboCASH Books

There must be an HTML JavaScript front end and that must be OpenAI compatible, so that AI is written core into the system

With the new information, please renumber the section 1 to 5 - expand to as many sections as you need.

### Questions & Answers

#### Q1: Can this be stored in a NoSQL database? Data can be archived into TurboCASH 5 and queried using a REST API.

**A:**  
Yes, the extracted and transformed data can be stored in a NoSQL database. This approach is suitable for AI workflows, as document-oriented databases (like MongoDB) handle flexible, JSON-like structures that are easily tokenized for AI models. Data can be archived or synchronized with TurboCASH 5 via its open API, enabling interoperability and REST-based queries.

#### Q2: Would Mongo be a good NoSQL database?

**A:**  
MongoDB is a strong choice for this use case. It is widely adopted, supports JSON documents natively, scales well, and integrates easily with JavaScript-based stacks. Its flexible schema is ideal for evolving accounting data and AI-driven requirements.

#### Q3: Would it be possible to make the NoSQL database interchangeable?

**A:**  
Yes, by abstracting the data access layer and using standard interfaces (e.g., via an ORM or repository pattern), the system can support interchangeable NoSQL databases. This allows switching between MongoDB, CouchDB, or other document stores with minimal changes to application logic.

Are we missing teh structure of the extrated Data base - some king of NoSQL strusutre that is eas easilty ocovnerted to tokens? Pleas eexpmand

### 3.1. Extracted Data Structure for AI Workflows

- **Purpose:** To facilitate AI-powered features (e.g., RAG, natural language queries), data extracted from the Firebird SQL database should be transformed into a flexible, token-friendly format.
- **NoSQL Representation:** After ETL, records are mapped to a document-oriented NoSQL structure (e.g., JSON objects), which is easily convertible to tokens for AI models.
- **Example Structure:**
    ```json
    {
      "book_id": "12345",
      "customer": {
        "name": "Acme Corp",
        "address": "123 Main St",
        "contacts": ["info@acme.com"]
      },
      "transactions": [
        {
          "date": "2024-06-01",
          "amount": 1000,
          "type": "invoice"
        }
      ],
      "metadata": {
        "last_modified": "2024-06-10T12:00:00Z"
      }
    }
    ```
- **Advantages:**
    - **Tokenization:** JSON-like structures are natively supported by most AI tokenizers.
    - **Flexibility:** Easily accommodates new fields or changes in schema.
    - **Interoperability:** Can be indexed, searched, and retrieved efficiently for RAG and other AI workflows.
- **Conversion Process:**
    - ETL layer extracts relational data.
    - Transforms records into NoSQL (JSON) documents.
    - Stores in a transient NoSQL store or passes directly to AI modules.

- **Integration:** This structure is used by the RAG orchestration layer to provide relevant context to OpenAI-powered features, ensuring efficient and accurate tokenization for model input.

### 4. ETL & RAG Orchestration Layer
- ETL service extracts, transforms, and loads data from Firebird SQL.
- Data cleansing, normalization, and enrichment for AI consumption.
- RAG orchestration uses ETL output to provide context for AI workflows.
- Integrates with model context protocol for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

### 5. Frontend Layer
