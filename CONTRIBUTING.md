## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/philipdc/turbocash6.git
   cd turbocash6
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if any are added):

## Coding Standards

### HTML
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Maintain proper indentation (2 spaces)
- Include appropriate ARIA labels for accessibility
- Validate markup using W3C validator

### CSS
- Follow BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for class names
- Use CSS variables for colors and common values
- Keep selectors specific but not overly complex
- Group related properties together
- Add comments for complex styling

Example:
```css
/* Component: Navigation */
.nav {
  /* Layout */
  display: flex;
  
  /* Appearance */
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
}

.nav__item {
  padding: 1rem;
}

.nav__item--active {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

### JavaScript
- Use ES6+ features (const/let, arrow functions, template literals)
- Follow consistent naming conventions:
  - camelCase for variables and functions
  - PascalCase for classes
  - UPPER_CASE for constants
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Handle errors appropriately

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the account balance
 * @param {Array} transactions - Array of transaction objects
 * @returns {Number} The calculated balance
 */
function calculateBalance(transactions) {
  return transactions.reduce((sum, transaction) => {
    return sum + transaction.amount;
  }, 0);
}
```

### File Organization
- Keep files small and focused
- Use descriptive file names (kebab-case)
- Place files in appropriate directories
- Import/export modules properly

```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

```
